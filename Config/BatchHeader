# MultiContour Analysis Configuration for Fire Line Analysis
# Analysis
ANALYSIS_NAME: 4_18_2017-Cam3
# Results from the analysis are stored in these files:
#     <Analysis_Name>-Analysis.txt
#     <Analysis_Name>-Contour.jpg

# Field of View (FOV) horizontal coverage width of the imagery (meters)
FOV: 6.3
# IMAGERY_WIDTH & IMAGERY HEIGHT allow the user to impose a standardized imagery size-- if desired
IMAGERY_WIDTH: 760
IMAGERY_HEIGHT: 1024
# North: provide simple orientation of the imagery and fire progression with
# respect to compass points. valid settings: TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, & RIGHT.  Specifying
# top indicates that the top of image points to north. Default is TOP.
NORTH: TOP
# Time: elapsed time between photos in seconds
ELAPSED_TIME: 1.0
# Normal_Interval: number of pixels between generated normals from
# the inner fire contour. In other words, a stepping factor for the
# analysis.
NORMAL_INTERVAL: 5
# Set Averaging: Number of consecutive images that averaged together to
# provide a single imagery data point. (MAXIMUM 10)
SET_SIZE: 5
